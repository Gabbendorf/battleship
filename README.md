# Battleship

One player places a defined number of ships of various lengths on a grid made from 10 x 10 cells. The ships can be placed in any horizontal or vertical position, but not diagonally.  The aim of the second player is to sink all of the ships.

Once the ships have been placed, the other player selects the cells on the grid to attack. If the attacked cell was empty, the cell is marked as M (Missed). If the attacked cell had a ship placed on it, the hit is successful (H). If all the cells of a ship are hit, the ship is sunk (S). Once all the ships are sunk, the game is over and the player who attacked is the winner!

## Types and amounts of ships

* Submarine: size 1 cell, x 2.
* Destroyer: size 2 cells, x 2.
* Cruiser: size 3 cells, x 1.
